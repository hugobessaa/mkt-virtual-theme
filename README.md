# Mkt Virtual Theme
> Fast initial WordPress Theme development

# Installing

The fastest way to install the Mkt Virtual Theme is by using [Yeopress](https://github.com/wesleytodd/YeoPress), an [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator for WordPress.

To install Yeoman and Yeopress, run:

```bash
npm install --global yo generator-wordpress
```

To generate your WordPress website with Mkt Virtual Theme, execute this inside the project folder:

```bash
yo wordpress
```

Optionally you can use an `~/.yeopress` file to override Yeopress defaults. I recommend [this one](https://gist.github.com/hugobessaa/d16240c1a0b175de1ef8 "recommended .yeopress configuration file to be used with the Mkt Virtual Theme") when using the Mkt Virtual Theme.
